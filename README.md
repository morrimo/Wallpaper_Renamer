# Wallpaper_Renamer

Wallpaper Renamer is used to rename files based on the name of the folder they are in, and then coverts them to a png.

## Installation

Unzip the folder. The WallpaperRenamer application is ready to use!

## Usage

Enter the directory of the files you'd like to change, and hit enter.

In my examples, the directory is C:\Users\Morgan\Downloads\wallpapers.

Example files before renaming:

If you'd like to enter another directory, enter Y. If you're done, enter anything else to close the program.
